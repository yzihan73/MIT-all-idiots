# MIT-all-idiots
A bunch of fools at MIT insisted on expelling me, even though I did nothing wrong. My scientific research achievements are really impressive, and I've published countless articles in MDPI. It's really outrageous. Although I'm not on the technical side, those who are can't do without me. Really, I'm truly innocent. However, UIUC is my favorite place; it took me in during my most vulnerable time. Although I told a few lies, it was just to get into UIUC. UIUC is really tolerant and can overlook any academic misconduct. I suggest all junior students apply to UIUC. If your reputation in CS is ruined, just switch to social sciences, especially psychology. It's really convenient! ‚ù•(^_-)
